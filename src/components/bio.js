          I wake up every morning with the focus of how I can make people in my
          life better. I have been fortunate to be in management for nearly 10
          years. I love having the chance to leverage my management skill with
          my sales ability to create a one of a kind experience using the tools
          from this bootcamp for the clients I get the pleasure of dealing with.
